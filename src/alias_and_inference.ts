/**
 * In TypeScript, both 'type alias' and 'interface' are ways to define custom types.
 * 
 * A 'type alias' is a way to provide a new name for a type. It can represent primitive types, union types, intersection types, etc.
 * For example, 'Book' is a type alias for an object structure with 'id', 'title', 'author', and 'price' properties.
 * 
 * An 'interface' is a way to define the shape of an object. It can include properties and methods, and can be implemented by classes.
 * For example, 'Book1' is an interface that defines a structure for a book object with 'isbn', 'title', 'author', and an optional 'genre'.
 * 
 * The main differences between 'type alias' and 'interface' are:
 * - Interfaces create a new name that is used everywhere. Type aliases donâ€™t create a new name.
 * - Type aliases can represent primitive types, union types, intersection types, etc., while interfaces are primarily for defining object structures.
 * - Interfaces are more extensible because they can be reopened to add new properties. Type aliases can't be changed after they're made.
 * - Interfaces can implement and extend each other, which is not possible with type aliases.

/* 
- start with defining an interface Computer using interface keyword. 
this will serve as a blueprint for objects that will be of this type.

- Inside the interface, define the properties that the object should have.
In this case, we have id, brand, ram and storage.

-use the ? after storage property to indicate that this property is optional 
and may not exist on all objects of this type.

- also inside the interface, define any methods that the object should have. 
In this case, we have upgradeRam, which is a function that takes a number

interface. this object should have all the properties and defined in the interface
